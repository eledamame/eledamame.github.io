My name is Eleanor and I am currently wrapping up my PhD in Microbiology in the [Taga Lab](https://tagalab.berkeley.edu/) in the Plant and Microbial Biology Department at UC Berkeley.

This web portfolio is still under construction... how embarrassing! Thanks for being here, though--if you'd like to contact me my email link in the side bar should work.

In the meantime, this template is from [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/) but I'm doing my best to slowly incorporate my own personality and taste into the site!

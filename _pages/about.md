*~ welcome to my github site ~*

My name is Eleanor and I am currently wrapping up my PhD in Microbiology in the [Taga Lab](https://tagalab.berkeley.edu/) in the Plant and Microbial Biology Department at UC Berkeley.

## briefly about me
In no particular order, my interests include intersectional climate justice, microbial and human communities, journalism, data visualization, illustration, storytelling, my cat, climbing, & probably more things.

### a couple of notes

This web portfolio is still under construction... how embarrassing! Thanks for being here, though--if you'd like to contact me my email link in the side bar should work. I'd be more than happy to send you examples of my work or answer questions about myself.

In the meantime, this template is from [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/) but I'm doing my best to slowly incorporate my own personality and taste into the site!
